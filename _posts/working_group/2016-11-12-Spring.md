We are looking for new members and suggestions for what to read next. Please let Son Van know by sending an email to the following email address: <sonv@andrew.cmu.edu>.

The following is a list of suggested topics with (very) condensed reasons from members. If you vote for any of these, please also email Son.

1. Rough path theory. Reason: hot topic, "which contain a vast universe of materials ranging from algebra and geometry to PDE and stochastic calculus."

2. Mean field games. Reason: hot topic invented by P.L. Lions that is related to optimal transport.

3. Something related to geometry. Reason: to understand how to do PDEs on manifolds and broaden the mathematical toolbox to understand other fields such as physics and computer science.

4. Geometric measure theory. Reason: very useful tool and we have a lot of experts in the house.

Participants registered so far: Kevin Ou, Son Van
