Based on the result of the poll, we will be learning the theory of Mean Field Games.

Mean Field Games as a mathematical discipline were pioneered by Pierre-Louis Lions and model the actions of large populations (or particles) which interact somehow with their near neighbors. The population here is viewed as a continuum or density, allowing us to use PDE techniques in our analysis.

The standard Toy Model of Mean Field Games is the "wave" that you might see in the stands of a Pirates Game- You choose to sit or stand based on the people sitting next to you, and the result is a standing wave in the crowd.

For our text, there is a 60 page pdf available online by Gu√©ant, Lasry, and Lions from 2009.
