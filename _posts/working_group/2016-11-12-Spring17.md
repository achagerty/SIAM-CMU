We are looking for new members and suggestions for what to read next. Please let Son Van know by sending an email to the following email address: <sonv@andrew.cmu.edu>.

The following is a list of suggested topics with (very) condensed reasons from members. If you vote for any of these, please also email Son.

1. Rough path theory. Reason: hot topic, "which contain a vast universe of materials ranging from algebra and geometry to PDE and stochastic calculus."

2. Mean field games. Reason: hot topic invented by P.L. Lions that is related to optimal transport.

3. Something related to geometry. Reason: to understand how to do PDEs on manifolds and broaden the mathematical toolbox to understand other fields such as physics and computer science.

4. Geometric measure theory. Reason: very useful tool and we have a lot of experts in the house.

5. Game theory and optimal control. Reason: this could be considered as the finite case of mean field games. This is also an important area in applied mathematics.

6. Potential theory.

7. Nonlinear dispersive PDE. Reason: this include the nonlinear schrodinger and the KdV equations. This is also a good excuse to learn more harmonic analysis.

Participants registered so far (in no particular order): Kevin Ou, Son Van, Yue Pu, Han Nguyen, Sam Cohn, Ryan Xu, Won Eui Hong
