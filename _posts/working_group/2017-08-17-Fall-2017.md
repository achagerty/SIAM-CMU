### The first meeting will be in WEH 8201 on August 31.###

Geometric Measure Theory is voted to be the topic this semester. We will meet every week on **Thursday, 2:30-3:30** in **WEH 7218**.

We will most likely follow the lecture notes by Leon Simon, which is available [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/math285/ts-gmt.pdf).

Another great resource is Frank Morgan's book, which is freely available to CMU students [via the library](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128044896).
