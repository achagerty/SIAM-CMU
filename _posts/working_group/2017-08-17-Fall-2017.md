### The first meeting will be in WEH 8201 on August 31.###

Geometric Measure Theory is voted to be the topic this semester. We will meet every week on **Thursday, 2:30-3:30** in **WEH 7218**.

We will most likely follow the lecture notes by Leon Simon, which is available [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/math285/ts-gmt.pdf).

Another great resource is Frank Morgan's book, which is freely available to CMU students [via the library](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128044896).

For the first part of the working group, good references are:

  * Evans & Gariepy's "Measure theory and fine properties of functions"

  * Maggi's "Sets of finite perimeter and geometric variational problems". This is available [via the library](http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/cm/detail.action?docID=989154) as well.

If you are bored about the pace of the working group, here're [some movies](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0E0n75oNCDleNYItxl93ckbQjSOkCXtQ) that could excite you.
