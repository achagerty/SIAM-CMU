#### Abstract

A classical result of Hoffman (1952) shows that the distance from a point $u$ to a non-empty polyhedron defined by the system of inequalities $Ax \le b$ can be bounded above in terms of the "error" or "residual" $(Au-b)\_+ = max(0,Au-b)$.  More precisely, the distance from $u$ to the polyhedron $\{x: Ax \le b\}$ is bounded above by $H(A)\cdot \|(Au-b)\_+\|$ for some Hoffman constant $H(A)$ that depends only on the matrix $A$.  This type of "error bound" plays a fundamental role for establishing convergence properties of a wide variety of algorithms for optimization problems.

This talk will give a novel and constructive proof of existence and characterization of the Hoffman constant $H(A)$.  We highlight the striking similarity between the Hoffman constant $H(A)$ and the smallest singular value of $A$. The new characterization of the Hoffman constant yields some interesting new insights and an algorithm to compute $H(A)$ -- a notoriously difficult computational problem.

The talk will be entirely self-contained and easily accessible.  The only required prior knowledge is basic matrix algebra.
