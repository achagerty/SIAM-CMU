#### Abstract


The main challenge of Cosmology in the 21st century is to understand the
nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which combined seem to account for a
staggering 95% of our Universe despite remaining complete mysteries. To shed
some much needed light on these questions, Cosmologists rely on a variety of
probes such as measuring the Cosmic Microwave Background (relic radiation from
the early Universe) or the gravitational lensing effect (deflection of light
rays by massive structures). However, extracting cosmological information from
the raw data collected by current or next generation surveys involves a large
number of statistical and signal processing challenges.
In this talk I will first present applications of sparse signal representation
(e.g. wavelets) to address some of these challenges, in particular to solve
large scale inverse problems (Compressed Sensing theory). I will also present
some exciting applications of deep learning, including very recent
developments based on graph theory.
