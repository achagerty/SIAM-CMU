#### Abstract

This talk will highlight various areas of mathematics that get used frequently in theoretical economics.  I will use my own research on a particular dynamic economic model -- the so-called overlapping generations model -- to highlight the applications of the mathematics of constrained optimization in economic analysis, the study of solutions to non-linear equations, and mathematical applications that arise in the study of stochastic dynamic economic systems.
