#### Abstract

In this talk I will give an overview on some machine learning
problems that can be posed as variational problems. I will look at
methods such as k-means, spectral clustering, graph based regression,
and neural networks. Often, the limit I will be interested in are as the
number of data points goes to infinity. In the graph setting this
requires a discrete-to-continuum topology which I will recall. The talk
is aimed at a wide audience; I will neither assume knowledge of
variational methods or machine learning.
